# Tree-Based Prediction Models on Titanic Dataset
## Summary
Just wanted to perform a quick analysis using Tree-Based Models to make a prediction on the Titanic dataset. Many have done and contributed their exploratory data analyses in Kaggle. Based on these analyses, the focus here is to perform some quick data transformation and feature engineering, follow by model training and prediction. Finally, generating the submission csv for assessment in Kaggle.

## Data
